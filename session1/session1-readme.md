# Session 1

Session 1 data was gathered on May 17, 2018 in the Board Room of the Toy Factory Lofts.

We laid out a grid on the ground that was roughly in line with 2 carpet tiles on the floor.
These grid squares were just over 1 meter apart, approximately 102.5 cm.  

The grid-squares near the edges are a different size. The measurements.ods file provides
some of those sizes. Measurements.ods was taken from the perspective in captures 1-4.
After capture4, we changed all of the camera positions and so the measurements.ods file
may not make sense.

Also, several of the captures unfortunately became unaligned from the calibration image.
They are therefore unusable unless we are testing what happens when a camera becomes
decalibrated. Captures 4, 5, 7 and 8 are all significantly desynchronized from the 
calibration image. Captures 2 and 3 are slightly desynchronized, and capture 6 slowly
desynchronizes throughout the capture (you can see the camera slowly panning downwards
as the capture took place).

Therefore, our best captures are:
- Capture 1
- Capture 9
- Capture 10

Our second best captures are:
- Capture 2
- Capture 3
- Capture 6

And our worst, basically unusable captures are:
- Capture 4
- Capture 5
- Capture 7
- Capture 8

Additionally, capture 1 used a different naming scheme for its image files. Be careful
here, because the default alphabetical sorting will create the wrong order for every 
other frame.

The storemap was done too scale, and all of the grid-lines are lined up exactly
as where they are in the captures.
